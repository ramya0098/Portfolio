  Hi, I'm <strong>Ramya Mutyam</strong> — a passionate
  <strong>Frontend Developer & UI Designer</strong> who loves creating clean,
  modern, and user-friendly web interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  I specialize in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> and have strong
  interest in UI/UX design. I enjoy converting ideas into responsive,
  pixel-perfect designs and building smooth user experiences.
</p>

<p>
  I’m a creative person with an eye for detail. I enjoy solving layout
  problems, experimenting with modern design trends, and constantly improving
  my skills. My strengths are my creativity, consistency, and ability to 
  learn new tools quickly.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I'm looking for opportunities where I can apply my frontend and
  UI skills, work with real projects, and grow as a developer.
